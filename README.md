# groupwalk

The groupwalk package contains the group-walk algorithm. Group-walk is a
procedure that uses a target-decoy competition framework for rejecting
multiple hypotheses when there is a presence of group structure.
Group-walk controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a user-specified
threshold. Details regarding group-walk and its applications can be
found here:
